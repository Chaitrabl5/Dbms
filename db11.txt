Operators are used to perform some action on the operands(i.e input data) for performing comparisons and computations and filter the data as required.

SQL mainly provides the following
set of operators

SQL Arithmetic Operators
SQL Comparison Operators
SQL Logical Operators
SQL Special operators


SQL Arithmetic operators
SQL provides five basic arithmetic operators, assume if a =10, b=20.

+	a + b will give 30
–	a – b will give -10
*	a * b will give 200
/	b / a will give 2
%	b % a will give 0
select empno,ename,sal,sal*12 as annsal,sal/12 as comm
from emp;

SQL Bitwise operators
Bitwise operators apply true false conditions on the individual binary bits of numbers

Bitwise AND(&): Returns true you only are both input bits are true otherwise false
Bitwise OR(|): Returns true if either of the input bits is true otherwise false
Bitwise XOR(^): Returns true only if both the input bits are different
 

SQL comparison(Relational)  operators
Comparison operators are generally used along with where clause for filtering the data as per the required condition specified

Assume variable a holds 10 and variable b holds 20 then

Operator	Example
=	(a = b) is not true.
!=	(a != b) is true.
>	(a > b) is not true.
<	(a < b) is true.
>=	(a >= b) is not true.
<=	(a <= b) is true.
!<	(a !< b) is false.
!>	(a !> b) is true.
Example
select empno,ename,sal,job
from emp
where sal>2500;

SQL Logical operators
AND operator
The AND results true only when all the conjunction of conditions specified after the where clause are satisfied

Example

select * from emp
where job='MANAGER' AND sal>2500;

OR operator
Among multiple conditions specified in the where clause  the transaction is performed if any of the condition becomes true

Example
select * from emp
where JOB='ANALYST' OR JOB='MANAGER';

SQL Special Operators
IN operator
It is used to specify a set of values and operation n is performed on all the values specified in the set and if any of the value that is present in the list matches with the values present in a table then it returns true and is operation is performed

Example
select empno,job,sal,hiredate from emp
where ename in('SCOTT','FORD','SMITH','JONES')

BETWEEN Operator
It is used to perform data comparison and manipulation over a range of values present in the database table

Example
select empno,job,sal,hiredate 
from emp
where sal between 800 and 2900;

LIKE  operator
The like operator is a pattern matching operator and returns those records that match the specified pattern

Example
select empno,ename,hiredate,sal,job
from emp
where ename like 'S%';

IS NULL operator
All operations upon null values present in the table must be done using this ‘is null’ operator .we cannot compare null value using the assignment operator

Example
select * from emp
where comm is null
