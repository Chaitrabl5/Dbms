SQL Expressions in DBMS
An expression is a combination of data, operators and other functions  which finally computes to obtain a value

Basic Syntax for SQL expressions usage
SELECT column1, column2, columnN 
FROM table_name 
WHERE [CONDITION|EXPRESSION];

Boolean Expressions
Boolean expressions generally correspond to a condition specified in the where clause for retrieving the required set of data
Whenever the data you specified in the expression is matched with the data in the table then the expression evaluates to true and the record is obtained
Syntax
SELECT column1, column2, columnN 
FROM table_name 
WHERE SINGLE VALUE MATCHING EXPRESSION;

select empno,ename,job,deptno,sal
from emp
where deptno=20;

Numeric expression
These expressions are  used to perform arithmetical calculations on the data present in the table

Syntax
SELECT numerical_expression as OPERATION_NAME
[FROM table_name
WHERE CONDITION] ;
Example
select ename,job,sal,sal*12 as annualsalary ,sal/4 as bonus from emp;

Date expression
Date expression performs manipulation on ‘date data type ‘values
It is also used to return the current system, date timestamp and arithmetic operations on date values
Example
SELECT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,sysdate from dual;


CREATE TABLE
Create command is used to create a table in the database with the structure specified by the user
This structure includes the number of columns to be present in the table and the data type of the column, size of data, etc
Basic Syntax for CREATE
CREATE TABLE table_name
(
column1 datatype(size),
column2 datatype(size),
column3 datatype(size),
.....
columnN datatype(size),
PRIMARY KEY( one or more columns )
);
Example
create table emp( 
empno number(4,0), 
ename varchar2(10), 
job varchar2(9), 
mgr number(4,0), 
hiredate date, 
sal number(7,2), 
deptno number(2,0) 
PRIMARY KEY (ID)
);

Creating a new table from an existing table
We can create a new table with exactly the same structure of any of the existing tables
Here an empty table with exactly the same structure of the existing table is created but data and constraints of the table are not copied
Example
create table
sample as (select * from emp);
