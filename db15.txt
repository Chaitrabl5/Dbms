WHERE  clause is used to specify a condition while retrieving and updating data from the database table and display only those
 records in the table for which the condition specified in the where clause becomes true
The WHERE clause is most commonly used with a select, update and delete  statements

General Syntax for WHERE clause
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;

AND clause
Definition: The AND results true only when all the conjunction of conditions specified after the where clause are satisfied

Syntax:
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition1 AND condition2 AND condition3 ...;

OR clause
Definition: Among multiple conditions specified in the where clause  the transaction is performed if any of the condition becomes true

Syntax
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition1 OR condition2 OR condition3 ...

Combining AND and OR
In the where clause it is possible that a condition is specified as a conjunction of both AND  & OR 

Syntax:
SELECT * FROM table_name 
WHERE condition1 AND|OR (condition2 AND|OR condition3....);


he UPDATE  statement is used to modify or change the data of the existing table in the database
We can update a single column as well as multiple columns as per our requirement
The general syntax of UPDATE
UPDATE table_name
SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ...
WHERE condition;
The SET  is Is used to set new values to the required column and the where Clause is used to filter
 the rows for which rows of data are needed to be updated

DELETE statement is used to delete  single or multiple records present in the existing database table based on a specific condition

Basic Syntax for the DELETE  statement
DELETE FROM table_name
WHERE condition;

DELETE V/S TRUNCATE
Both these commands delete and truncate  make a table empty but there are certain differences where a super learner must be aware of
TRUNCATE command usage
truncate table emp;
It removes all rows from a Table and makes a table empty
This operation cannot be rolled back (table cannot be restored) and no triggers will be fired
You cannot use a where clause and delete particular records you need to delete enter table data
Truncate is faster and does not use a match under space as delete
DELETE command usage
delete from emp;
Delete command is also used to remove rows from a table
You can delete whether only particular records by using a condition with where a clause or entire rows can be deleted without using where class
After performing delete operation the transactions can be rollbacked i.e that is a table can be restored after deleting 
To make the changes permanent in a delete operation need to commit the transaction commit or rollback
