LIKE  operator

If you want to search all employees starting with letter P or names of all products which which consists of exactly 4 letters etc
LIKE  in DBMS operator used to search specified pattern in the data and retrieve the record when there is a pattern match as required

General Syntax for LIKE:
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE column LIKE pattern;
Wildcard operators
% : Percent(%)represents 0,1 or multiple characters
_   : Underscore(_) is used to match exactly a single character


ORDER BY in DBMS
The order by clause is used to arrange the fetched data from the database table in ascending or descending order of data values based on one or more columns

Syntax
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
ORDER BY column1, column2, ... ASC|DESC;
ASC: Displays data based on increasing order of values in the column
DESC: Displays data based on decreasing order of values in the column

select ename ,sal*12 annsal ,job,hiredate
from emp
order by annsal desc;

Group by clause in SQL used to arrange logically related data into groups with
 help of some functions i.e  if a particular column has the same type of data in 
 different rows then they can be organized this into a logical groups.

General Syntax for GROUP BY in DBMS
SELECT column_name(s),function(column_name)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition
GROUP BY column_name(s)
ORDER BY column_name(s);

Using  WHERE  clause in the GROUP BY
Using where clause  rows  can be pre excluded before dividing them into groups, where clause  must be specified before the  group by clause  when it is used in the query

Example
select deptno,max(sal)
from emp
where deptno!=30
group by deptno;

Using ORDER BY with GROUP BY
We can also display the rows in sorted order after logical organizing into groups using order by clause along with group by clause

Example
select deptno,max(sal) 
from emp
group by deptno
order by deptno;

HAVING  clause
Having Clause is used to place conditions and decide which group will be part of the final result
You cannot use aggregate functions like sum() count() etc with  where clause
Hence we need to use having clause if you want to specify conditions using this aggregate functions
Example
SELECT ename , SUM(sal) FROM emp
GROUP BY ename
HAVING SUM(sal)>2000;

Displaying top N rows
Suppose if you want to display the top three rows present in emp table then you can use this rownum along with the relational operator

Example
select rownum,empno,ename,job,sal,deptno 
FROM EMP
where rownum<=3;

TRUNCATE command
The truncate command will make the table empty i.e all the table data will be deleted but the structure and database object is still alive and the table can be reused normally
The truncate command logically nothing but using delete command for deleting the records in the table without specifying the where condition i.e all the rows get deleted in that case
Syntax
TRUNCATE TABLE table_name;

Dropping a table using DROP in DBMS
Drop command delete the table existence completely i.e drop statement destroys the existing database object of that particular table, index or view
After dropping a table if you try to use the table then compiler shows an error as ” table or view does not exist“
Syntax
DROP TABLE table_name;

Restoring a dropped table using FLASHBACK Command
Before Oracle 10g whenever we use a drop command the table is permanently deleted but from Oracle 10g onwards we can get back the table from recycle bin by using flashback command.

Syntax
flashback table table_ name to before drop
