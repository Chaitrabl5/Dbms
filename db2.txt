Data Abstraction:
Data abstraction refers to the hiding of details from users at certain levels,
 for authentication and security purpose


 Data Independence:
These levels of abstraction provide data independence i.e is all the transactions or  changes made at
one level are unaffected to other levels


Types of Data Models in DBMS
 

Hierarchical database model
Relational model
Network model
Entity-relationship model
Object-oriented database model
Document model
Entity-attribute-value model
Star schema

Entity – These are representation of a real world entities in code.
Attributes – These are the characteristic properties of entities
Relationship – Logical relationship between various entities involved in the Database creation.
One to one
One to many
Many to one
Many to many


Hierarchical data model is being used from the 1960s onwards where data is organized like a tree structure

Data Organisation in the network model is just like a graph rather than a tree, a child record can have any number of parent records

ERmodel is an illustration of various entities in business and the relationship between them 
It is built during the analysis phase of the system development life cycle 
The ER model separates the information required in the business i.e it establishes a clear distinction between data that is useful and not useful for business operations 

The basic idea between this relational data model is simple two-dimensional tables, also called relations which consist of rows and columns.
Advantages of the relational model  
Data integrity for accuracy and consistency 
No data redundancy 
Access control and integrity in the form of constraints which enables validation before entering and accessing the data 
Provides high security 
Supports to store any type any data types(numbers, characters, date, images, audios, text files )
Data can be managed and used by several users at a time.
Data can be shared across several platforms.

Oracle 10g a most popularly used RDBMS is proven to be the fastest database for transaction processing including data warehousing and third-party application on several servers of all sizes.



 object-oriented database stores complex data and relationships between data directly, without mapping any links to relational rows and columns.


Data Hiding: Giving access to only required data at different levels of users
 Inheritance: data reusability 
Data security and integrity: Providing different levels of access to different levels of users using access modifiers, validations, authentication
Polymorphism: Using the same object in different ways
Encapsulation: Combining different data from different units into a consolidated one
