Joins in DBMS:
Joints are used to retrieve data from multiple tables 
i.e it is used for data merging

Inner Join-
Definition: The inner join returns only matching rows, here columns that are used in join condition must belong to the same type, when tables having common column then only we are allowed how to use inner join
Inner join performance is very high compared to Oracle 8i equal join
Inner Join Example:
select ename,loc from
emp
join 
dept
on emp.deptno=dept.deptno
where loc='CHICAGO';

Left outer join-
Definition: Left  join always returns all rows from the left table and matching rows from right side table and also returns null values in the place of nonmatching rows in another table

Left join Example
select rownum ,ename,loc from
emp
LEFT join 
dept
on emp.deptno=dept.deptno 
where loc='DALLAS';

Right outer join
Definition: Right join always return all rows from right side table and matching rows from the left table and also returns null values in the place of nonmatching rows in another table

Example for Right Outer join
select rownum,ename,loc from
emp
RIGHT join 
dept
on emp.deptno=dept.deptno where loc!='CHICAGO' ;


Full Outer join
Definition: Full join returns all rows from both  tables because it is viewed as a union of a left, right and inner join, It also returns null values in the place of nonmatching rows tuples

Full Outer join example
select rownum,ename,loc,job,mgr from
emp
FULL OUTER JOIN 
dept
on emp.deptno=dept.deptno ;


Natural join
Natural Join also returns matching rows only, this join performance is very high compared to inner join Definition: In this join, you are not required to use join condition explicitly, in this case, resource tables must have a common column, based on this oracle server itself internal establishes join condition
Natural Join Example
select rownum,ename,loc from
emp
NATURAL join 
dept
where loc='CHICAGO';


Cross join
Definition: In this type of join data in each and, every row in  one table is added to all the rows in  another table
Here cross product operation  performed

Here we have 14 rows in emp table and 4 rows in dept table hence 14*4=56 records are displayed if the cross join is performed on these tables without condition specified

Cross Join example
select rownum,ename,sal,dname,loc from 
emp 
cross join
dept
where loc='CHICAGO';
